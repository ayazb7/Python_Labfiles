  Cricket is played by two teams of 11, with one
  side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs,
  <br>
  while the other team will bowl and field the
  ball to restrict the opposition from scoring.
  <br>
  The main objective in cricket is to score as many
  runs as possible against the opponent.
